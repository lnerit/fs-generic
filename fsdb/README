>> To test the debugger as a stand-alone program, run "python pdbTest.py 10 200". To test the debugger with fs, use the following steps.

1. Import the package in the controller code
	from fsdb import pdb as bp

2. Set a break point at any point in the code using 
	bp.set_trace()
  
>> FSDB has the following capabilities

- Sticky mode
- Unhide hidden frames
- Rehide hidden frames
- Longlist source code during debugging
- Shortlist source code during debugging
- Pretty print expressions
- Recursive debugger
- Interact interpreter with all variables in scope
- Track a variable
- Watch/unwatch variable
- Access the value of any variable by typing variable name
- Default GDB options like continue, step, print stack, up, down, frame
- Edit files during dubugging
- Extensive post-mortem
- Enable/disable break points on the fly
- Trace packet through the network
- Packet replay feature added
