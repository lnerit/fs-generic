fsReplay animator is extended from ns animator (NsNam). We modified the code 
available at "http://www.nsnam.org/docs/release/3.10/manual/html/animation.html".

To build animator:
  1) Install Qt (v4) library from http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/installation.html
  2) qmake fsReplay/NetAnim.pro
  3) Makefile should be created in the fsReplay directory
  4) Build with "make"
  5) Test animator with: ./fsReplay dumbbell.tr
                            or
                         ./fsReplay grid.tr

Compile Issues:
  If make fails, ensure that the qt4 version of qtmake is being used.  If you have 
  qt4 installed, but can't issue qmake command, it may need to be added to the path, 
  or simply specify the full path the the executable.
